**Executive Summary**

VoteSecure is a decentralized application (dApp) for running transparent, tamper evident, and privacy preserving elections and polls. It leverages the Nervos CKB (Common Knowledge Base) blockchain for public verifiability while keeping voter choices confidential. The application is open source and designed so results can be independently audited without trusting a central authority.
